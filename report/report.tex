\section*{Preface}

The topic "Pusher Mechanism" was assigned as a final project by the Department of Informatik 12: Software and Tools for Computational Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, for the Software Lab course in the Computational Engineering Science B.Sc. program. This work was carried out under the supervision of Dr. rer. nat. Markus Towara.

This project involves developing an enhanced version of the well-known planar four-bar linkage, a mechanical system widely used in applications like conveyor systems, oil well pumps, and robotic arms. By adding an extra joint, the extended mechanism offers more degrees of freedom, making it better suited for specific tasks. In this work, we designed and implemented this extended four-bar linkage to find a suitable mechanism for moving a box along a conveyor while avoiding obstacles.

In the first phase of the project, we analyzed the user requirements provided by our supervisor and broke them down into system requirements. This was followed by a theoretical analysis of the mechanism's geometry. Based on this analysis, we selected Python as the implementation environment due to its suitability for the task and the team's expertise.

The implementation consists of three interconnected components. First, the backend was developed to handle the geometry of the linkage, calculating the coordinates of all joints based on input parameters to ensure accurate modeling.

The second component is the frontend, a graphical user interface (GUI) created with the Tkinter\footnote{https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html} library. It enables users to visualize the linkage’s movement, modify its parameters, and display essential information about the mechanism.

Additionally, a well-documented testing process was carried out to ensure the correctness and reliability of both the backend and frontend. This testing verified the system's performance across various scenarios, ensuring its accuracy and robustness.

With our implementation, we successfully addressed the optimization problem of moving a box along a conveyor while avoiding obstacles. The addition of an extra joint to the four-bar linkage provided the necessary degrees of freedom, enabling precise trajectory design. This solution met the system and user requirements and demonstrated the mechanism's effectiveness in achieving task-specific motion.

Furthermore, detailed documentation of the software and project management processes was created to enhance maintainability and offer a clear understanding of the project’s structure. This documentation ensures that future developers or users can efficiently modify and extend the system. Overall, this work demonstrates the successful combination of theoretical analysis, design, and practical implementation in creating a functional pusher mechanism.

\section{Introduction}

The industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries brought about significant advancements in manufacturing processes, one of which was the challenge of transporting products efficiently between various workstations in factories. A key solution to this challenge was the development of mechanical systems like the four-bar linkage, which can be used as a pusher mechanism to move products along production lines or between different conveyor systems. Despite its simple structure, the four-bar linkage has proven to be an effective mechanism in various industrial applications. 

Over time, the four-bar linkage model has expanded beyond basic conveyor systems and has found applications in more complex systems, such as pumpjacks, robotic arms, and automotive engineering. Its simplicity and efficiency continue to make it relevant in modern mechanical design.

In this work, we aim to analyze the theoretical principles behind the four-bar linkage, design and implement an extended version of the mechanism with an additional joint, named coupler (see Figures \ref{fig:linkage-1} and \ref{fig:linkage-2}), and apply it to solve the problem of moving a box along a production line while avoiding obstacles. By enhancing the classic four-bar linkage, we seek to provide a more flexible solution suited to complex real-world tasks.

The structure of this paper is as follows: In Section \ref{ch:analysis}, we analyze the user requirements, derive the system requirements, and provide an overview of the theoretical analysis of the mechanism’s geometry. Section \ref{ch:design} covers the selection of the implementation environment, taking into account the system requirements and the team's expertise, as well as the preparation of UML class models for the implementation phase. Section \ref{ch:implementation} describes the implementation of the four-bar linkage, the graphical user interface, and the software testing process, while Section \ref{ch:doc} provides software documentation to ensure its maintainability. In Section \ref{ch:optimization-problem}, we use the developed software to determine the appropriate mechanism parameters to move the box along the conveyor. Finally, in Sections \ref{ch:projectmanagement}, we discuss our project management.

\section{Analysis} \label{ch:analysis}

\subsection{User Requirements}

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./figures/uml_use_case.pdf}
	\caption{UML use case diagram}
	\label{fig:use_case}
\end{figure}

User requirements outline the overall vision for how a system should function and what features it must provide to meet user needs. These high-level expectations are the foundation for developers to derive more detailed and technical system requirements, which define constraints and specifications the software must fulfill.

To enhance understanding of the user requirements described later, we provide a UML use case diagram of user-software interactions in Figure \ref{fig:use_case}. The diagram illustrates the main workflow: after starting the program, the user is presented with a default visualization of the four-bar linkage generated by the GUI and the linkage model. The user can modify this visualization by specifying input parameters through the GUI. Additionally, the four-bar linkage can be animated, with the input angle gradually increasing and the visualization updating every 25 ms upon the user’s explicit request.

The following list presents all the user requirements provided by our supervisor, along with our explanations and interpretations of each concept.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Requirement: Implement all motion types of a planar four-bar linkage extended with a coupler.}
	
	The planar four-bar linkage extended with a coupler, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:linkage-2}, may appear to be a straightforward geometric structure. However, its motion is more complex than it seems. While the coupler $P$ does not influence the primary motion constraints, the lengths of the four main bars define the limitations of the input angle $\alpha$. These constraints can result in the input angle being unlimited, symmetrically limited, or asymmetrically limited relative to the ground link $AB$. Consequently, the links $AD$ and $BC$ can function as either cranks, capable of full rotation, or rockers, which only partially rotate. In fact, as explained in \cite{inproceedings}, 27 distinct motion types for such mechanisms have been identified. A deeper analysis of these motion types will be conducted in the theoretical section of our study.
	
	\item \textit{Requirement: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to display four-bar linkage animation and customize its geometric parameters.}
	
	The GUI should enable users to visualize the linkage, provide smooth animations, and adjust various geometric parameters of the system. We have identified eight key parameters (degrees of freedom, shown in Figure \ref{fig:linkage-2}) that the GUI should support:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The lengths of the four bars ($AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $AD$).
		\item The angle $\theta$ between the fixed bar $AB$ and the horizontal line.
		\item The input angle $\alpha$ between the bar $AD$ and the horizontal line.
		\item The position of the coupler relative to the middle of the floating link, expressed by $P_{pos}$ and $P_{offset}$.
	\end{itemize}
	During the animation process, the input angle $\alpha$ is no longer a free parameter, as it is dynamically determined by the system to ensure smooth motion.
	
	Additionally, while the position of point $A$ could be considered an independent parameter (technically two parameters in 2D), for simplicity, we assume it is fixed at $(0, 0)$ during geometric analysis. If point $A$ needs to be positioned elsewhere, the entire linkage can simply be translated accordingly. This fixed-point assumption will simplify the design phase but can be revisited for solving optimization problems later.
	
	\item \textit{Requirement: Determine suitable parameters for the four-bar linkage to solve the following optimization problem:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Push box with size $80\times60$ from $x=220$ to $x=0$
		\item Do not cross the area of the labeling machine (Area with $x<80$ and $y>70$).
		\item Pass above points $(120, 80)$ and $(220, 80)$
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./figures/optimization_problem_task.pdf}
		\caption{Optimization problem}
		\label{fig:optimization_problem}
	\end{figure}
	
	The optimization problem is illustrated in Figure  \ref{fig:optimization_problem}, which shows a conveyor line with the box to be moved by the coupler $P$ while avoiding the forbidden areas. The coupler $P$ must move the box, following a trajectory such as the dotted curve depicted in the figure. After pushing the box to the desired location, the coupler should return to its starting position, navigating around obstacles to repeat the task.
	
	At a minimum, the problem can be addressed manually by experimenting with different parameters to find a feasible solution. Ideally, however, an algorithm could be developed to automate the optimization process and identify the best parameters efficiently.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Requirements}

After reviewing and analyzing the user requirements, which provide a high-level perspective of the problem and its solution, we need to derive more detailed technical requirements and specifications for the software. The system requirements are categorized into two types: \textit{functional requirements}, which define what the software must do, and \textit{non-functional requirements}, which outline how the system should operate and perform.

We begin with the functional requirements, organized into several subtopics and accompanied by brief explanations for each.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Four-bar linkage model:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The model implements the geometry of the four-bar linkage, calculating joint coordinates based on input parameters.
		\item It simulates all 27 motion types of the four-bar linkage with a coupler.
		\item It ensures stable operation without crashes, regardless of the input parameters.
		\item It validates input data and sends error messages to the GUI for user feedback.
	\end{itemize}
	
	The four-bar linkage model acts as the backend of the system, accurately implementing the geometry and all motion types of the linkage. Its primary role is to provide reliable data for visualization in the GUI while ensuring error-free operation. By validating input parameters and communicating issues through the GUI, the system allows users to address errors efficiently without needing to restart.
	
	\item \textit{Tests:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Implement test cases to cover all motion types of the four-bar linkage.
		\item Provide reference data for result comparison.
	\end{itemize}
	
	To ensure the backend's accuracy, test cases must be implemented for each motion type, supported by reference data to validate the results.
	
	\item \textit{Graphical User Interface (GUI):}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The GUI incorporates the four-bar linkage model (backend), utilizing its geometry and motion cases for visualization and animation.
		\item It provides a visualization of the four-bar linkage.
		\item It contains sliders to allow users to input and adjust geometric parameters.
		\item It updates the visualization in real-time when new geometric parameters are provided.
		\item It includes an animation mode for smooth motion visualization of the four-bar linkage.
		\item It provides coupler tracing to display coupler's trajectory.
	\end{itemize}
	
	The GUI serves as the user’s primary interaction point (frontend), incorporating all functionalities relevant to user needs. Its main purpose is to visually represent the four-bar linkage using joint coordinates obtained from the backend. Users can adjust geometric parameters via sliders, with the visualization updating instantly to reflect changes. The GUI also includes an animation mode, ensuring smooth movement of the linkage. Additionally, the tracing of the coupler $P$ during animation is crucial for solving the optimization problem, providing valuable insights into its trajectory.
	
	\item \textit{Documentation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The four-bar linkage model, tests, and GUI are detailed documented.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for maintaining software. To ensure the system remains reusable for future developers, we document all components in detail.
\end{itemize}

After discussing the functional system requirements, which outline what the system must do, we now turn to the non-functional requirements, which describe how the system should do it.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Performance:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The four-bar linkage model must provide smooth animations.
		\item The GUI animations should run at a minimum of 30 frames per second. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	Performance is a critical factor for usability, as users expect quick responses without noticeable delays. To meet this requirement, the four-bar linkage model and GUI should be optimized to ensure smooth animations at 30 frames per second on standard computers (e.g., with an AMD Ryzen 4500U chip). This ensures that the system remains free of lag, providing a smooth user experience.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Geometry}

After analyzing the user requirements and deriving system ones, we focus at the geometry of the given linkage, that will be implemented as a part of four-bar linkage model and used to create visualization and animation later in the GUI.
